The story of Echo Echo!

Mount Kithairon - Home
Oread - What she is? Also = Mountain Nymph
Hera got jealous because Zeus would often visit Nymphs and he liked Echo, soooo...
She cursed her to only be able to repeat the last words that another person just said
Echo met Narcissus, who rejected her because of the curse
She followed him around, he found his own reflection, fell in love with himself, and died
She mourned for him and eventually died herself, leaving only her voice behind

Could talk about... 
A curse from Hera
One of Zeus' loves
Narcissus
Just say every last word twice, no reference to anything Greek


Narcissus =
Greek hunter from Thespiae in Boeotia
Known for his beauty
Son of a river god Cephissus

Narcissus (plant) - PLEASE USE SOMEPHOW!!!
